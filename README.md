# Installation Instructions
To begin the installation process I downloaded git and made a new github repository. Since I plan to be working in Colab, I used pip to install some useful packages: patchify (to divide the images into patches with the same dimensions) and segmentation-models. I then installed Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) and used ngrok as a reverse proxy software through Colab. Starting NNI and ngrok on the same port allowed me to access the url with my NNI experiment. I have attached a screenshot of the NNI UI from my computer.
